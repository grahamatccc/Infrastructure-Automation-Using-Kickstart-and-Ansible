# Infrastructure-Automation-Using-Kickstart-and-Ansible

This was created as part of my networking capstone for college. These playbook in combination are capable of setting up a simple network. It provides a DNS server, DHCP server, web server, a KVM server, and some test clients. Before trying to use these in any fashion, make that that the playbooks won't destroy any important data as the process is destructive (Wipes server for KVM, deleting VMs, etc.). You're on your own if anything goes horribly wrong. I guarantee that this script does not follow best practice for security. Best of luck! :D
